## Project Description
This project aims to identify and analyze the factors influencing the likelihood of NFL players receiving a second contract with the same team. The analysis focuses on the past four draft classes and considers attributes such as draft positions, player performance metrics, positional value, initial contract length, performance statistics, injury history, and team dynamics.

### Key Aspects to Explore
1. **Positional Analysis:** Identify which positions are most likely to have players secure a second contract with the same team.
2. **Performance Metrics:** Analyze the performance metrics (e.g., games played, touchdowns, tackles) that correlate with receiving a second contract.
3. **Draft Position Impact:** Examine how the draft position (early vs. late rounds) influences the chances of obtaining a second contract.
4. **Contract Length and Value:** Investigate the typical contract lengths and values of players who secure a second contract versus those who do not.
5. **Team Strategies:** Compare different team strategies for drafting and retaining players.
6. **Injury History:** Assess the impact of injury history on the likelihood of securing a second contract.
7. **Player Development:** Evaluate the role of player development and support systems within teams that contribute to retaining players.
8. **Economic Factors:** Consider the financial aspects and salary cap implications that affect second contract decisions.
9. **Career Longevity:** Analyze the average career longevity of players who secure a second contract with the same team compared to those who move to other teams.
10. **Comparative Analysis:** Use other teams as baselines to determine the relative success of different strategies in securing second contracts for their draft picks.

### Datasets to Be Used
1. [nfldatapy](https://pypi.org/project/nfldatapy/): A Python library providing data on NFL draft picks, player statistics, and contract details.
2. [NFL Contract and Draft Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasliusontag/nflcontractanddraftdata): Contains NFL contracts and draft pick data for players between 2000 and 2023.

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks
1. **Luis Llamas:** Set up the GitHub repository and PPT presentation, create a README.md file.
2. **Santiago Cardenas:** Data collection and preprocessing.
3. **Christian Fincher:** Data analysis and visualization.
4. **Jack Thomas:** Statistical analysis and report writing.

### Project Proposal
- **Title:** Analyzing NFL Draft Trends and Contracts Over the Last Four Years
- **Description:** Identifying key factors from recent NFL draft classes that contribute to a player's likelihood of securing a successful second contract with the same team.

### Data Standardization and Analysis
- **Data Standardization:** Create a dictionary to standardize team names, use a `.map` function to replace team names in the dataset with standardized names.
- **Identify Second Contracts:** Create a new column to indicate if a player has signed a second contract.
- **Expand Dataset:** Consider expanding the dataset to include second-round picks for comparison.
- **Player Records:** Ensure each player is uniquely counted and not duplicated in the dataset.
